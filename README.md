## Svelte Image Uploader

[shadcn-svelte](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/) is an amazing ui library but doesn't have an image uploader component. So I created one!

It has image validation built in and customizable styles with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The image is validated inside a shadcn Form using [zod](https://zod.dev), [svelte-drop-zone](https://github.com/thecodejack/svelte-file-dropzone#readme), [superforms](https://superforms.rocks), and [formsnap](https://formsnap.dev/docs).
